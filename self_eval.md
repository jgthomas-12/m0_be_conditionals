# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

- I feel pretty confident with the comparison operators. I'm having a little trouble with the retun values of true and false as far as using a method is concerned and how to manipulate that within a conditional statement. I feel confident that once I understand why I'm making the mistake, it will be easy to apply to other statements. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

- I feel comfortable with the logical operators. I feel like they will help to simplify things. Sometimes they are not my first attempt at a solution but usually help to combine some lines of code to make it cleaner and more simplified. 

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

- if statements make a lot of sense but can definitely get confusing. I find it's best to break things down one by one to help keep track of what is happening or expected. 

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

- I have spent more time that I expected to on this assignment. I got bogged down trying to implement `.include?` because I was using the method incorrectly. I also was having some trouble because Ruby doesn't formulate variables if your code is in 'single quotes' as opposed to "double quotes". 

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

- I need to remember how strong of a tool modulous (%) is. I also want to figure out why I was having so much trouble with .odd? and figure out why my attack with both that and .include? aren't working. I will adjust and review my calendar tonight after the slack check in.  

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

- I'd like learn how to utilize google in a more informative way. I think I could use more technical search terms to return more helpful material.
